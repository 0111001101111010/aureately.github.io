What do you think the world needs?

When asked this question in my design class, I instantly thought: easy-to-use interfaces, an application that pushes people to try new things, games that allow kids (and adults) to learn, motivation, feminism, never-ending curiosity, understanding—all of which are big ideas, things I’d like to see happen, and things I definitely stand for.

However, none of these had that oomph, that little feeling one gets when something just feels right. After having finished a project that pushed us to explore who we were as designers, as individual people with voices, complex stories, stylistic preferences, and desires, I felt the need to approach this project on a more personal level.

What do I need?

That is how this project started, which, I suppose, is more of an exploration of relationships and partly a campaign to get people thinking about how others treat them and how they, in turn, treat other people, particularly those whom they are close to.

One of my weaknesses ever since was showing affection; I’m always on my guard, and in the process, there are a lot of things left unsaid for fear of saying too much or being awkward. There is always the assumption that “Oh, they probably get it.”

The previous self-design project made me realize how temporal everything is. How long will I be here? How long will the people I care about be here? Do I matter to someone? Have I told someone that they matter to me?
