		<h2>Norfolk Arts District</h2>

		<p>This project is divided into two parts: <a href="#norfolk1">Web Design Class Mock-up</a>, and <a href="#norfolk2">Initial Landing Page pitch</a> for the actual upcoming Magazine District, formerly known as the Norfolk Arts District. This site, as well as the logo and branding were planned and talked about during the Code for America event, <a href="http://trishatobias.tumblr.com/post/52119882100/hack-for-change-norfolk-va-june-1-2013">Hack for Change: National Day of Civic Hacking</a>, last June 1, 2013.</p>

		<h4 id="norfolk1">Web Design Class Mock-up</h4>

		<p>This is a project for my Web Design class in Old Dominion University. The purpose of the assignment is to create a mock-up of a website promoting the up-and-coming Norfolk Arts District to be built North of Brambleton and centered along Granby Street, in Norfolk, Virginia. The website should raise awareness for the neighborhood project, garner support from people, and keep everyone updated on the progress.</p>
 
		<p>Below is the site map, and two created pages.</p>

		<p>The look and feel I decided for the site are based on my vision of it being a neutral entity. A neighborhood such as this would have many artists and people of different tastes and styles; finding the feel that would encompass most styles and not alienate certain groups of people is, therefore, essential. In the end, I decided to use browns and grays with orange as the accent color. The typefaces chosen are Cubano, Arvo and Ubuntu for their rounded forms. I went with a minimal, flat and abstract style, but added subtle texture to make the site less clinical and have that feeling of tangibility.</p>

		<p>The Support page would feature volunteer opportunities with links to more information about them, as well as a form to sign up for whichever one chooses. If one chooses to volunteer, they would be taken to the existing Better Block registration form. If one chooses to donate, they would be taken to the PayPal page. If one chooses to become a partner, they would be directed to another form where they could fill out the details. This is done so that the visitor would not feel overwhelmed.</p>
