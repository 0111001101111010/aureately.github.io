		<h2>Unplayed Piano</h2>

		<p>This is a project for Graphic Design IV class in Old Dominion University. The task was to create a visual representation of a song from a given list of artists. The song I chose was "Unplayed Piano" by Damien Rice.</p>
		 
		<p>"Unplayed Piano" was originally written to support the Free Aung San Suu Kyi 60th Birthday campaign. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and advocate for democracy, was under house arrest at that time. I viewed this as a vital aspect of the song.</p>
		 
		<p>For this project, I decided to use traditional materials: charcoal for the illustrations, and pen and ink for the lettering. I felt that charcoal would better capture the emotion of the song. To physically shape the images with my hands simply felt freeing, and allowed me to connect more with the piece. These 18 individual pieces at almost 13" x 14.5" in size were reduced to a 4" x 4.5" book. The lettering is done on a separate paper and added in Photoshop. This was then printed on classic linen paper to better go with the texture of the charcoal.</p>

		<p><b>Inside</b></p>
	 
		<p>The inside panels show the loneliness and dreariness of being subjected to that kind of detention. Suddenly, the once comforting place has become a great discomfort, a hindrance, a prison. However, a lot of things have happened since the campaign, and one of these is the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. I wanted to show this progression by lightening up the values, and to show that hope by creating a sudden change from the linear format of the book.</p>

		<p><b>Outside</b></p>
		 
		<p>The outside is a stark contrast to the inner panels. Throughout her house arrest, people continued to advocate for non-violence and democracy.</p>
